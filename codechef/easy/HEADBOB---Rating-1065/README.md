## Problem

### Tanu and Head-bob

Tanu has got interested in signs and gestures that we use for communication. One such gesture is the head-bob.
When we want to signal "Yes" to someone, we move the head up-and-down. For "No", the head is moved left-and-right, rotating about the vertical axis.
There is a peculiar way of gesturing "Yes", commonly seen in India, by moving head sideways (rotating about the forward-back axis). This is called the  *Indian head-bob*.

Tanu observed many people on the railways station, and made a list of gestures that they made. Usual "Yes" gesture is recorded as " **Y** ", no as " **N** " and Indian "Yes" gesture as " **I** ". (Assume no foreigner uses the Indian "Yes" gesture and vice-versa). Identify which of them were Indians, which were not Indian, and which one you cannot be sure about.

### Input
First line contains T, number of people observed by Tanu.
Each person is described in two lines. First line of the description contains a single integer N, the number of gestures recorded for this person. Next line contains a string of N characters, each character can be "Y", "N" or "I".
### Output
For each person, print "INDIAN" if he/she is from India, "NOT INDIAN" if not from India, and "NOT SURE" if the information is insufficient to make a decision.
### Constraints

```

```

 **For 30 points:** 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 100 **For 70 points:** 1 ≤ T,N ≤ 1000
### Sample 1:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int N = sc.nextInt();
            String s = sc.next();

            if (s.contains("I")) {
                System.out.println("INDIAN");
            } 
            else if (s.contains("Y")) {
                System.out.println("NOT INDIAN");
            } 
            else {
                System.out.println("NOT SURE");
            }
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
```
