## Problem

### Divisible by 3 and 5

Write a program to check whether the given numbers are divisible by both `3` and `5`.

The input has already been taken in the provided code. You only need to complete the logic and print the result for each number.

For each number:

- Print Divisible by both 3 and 5 if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Otherwise, print Not divisible by both 3 and 5.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
15
20
```

```
Divisible by both 3 and 5
Not divisible by both 3 and 5

```

### Explanation:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num;
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        //check the first number
        num = scanner.nextInt();
        if (num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Divisible by both 3 and 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not divisible by both 3 and 5");
        }

        //check the second number
        num = scanner.nextInt();
        if (num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Divisible by both 3 and 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not divisible by both 3 and 5");
        }
    }
}
